[Python script](get_twitter_data.py) scrapes tweets into zip files, currently configured for [House of Representatives](representatives.txt).

Tweet ID text files [source](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UIVHQR).

Note: original senate text file is missing, but the data is still [here](50000_senate.zip).

Congresspeople info file [source](https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.csv). This changes with every Congress (and isn't always correct on Twitter handles), so we store a fixed file here.
